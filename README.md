# FinalBIGv2

A PyQt GUI intended to supplant the outdated FinalBIG program in the manipulating of .big archives. FinalBIGv2 can do all the things FinalBIG can and more! It has the following additional features:

* Read support for more than just text files including:
    * Music files (currently disabled)
    * CAH files
* Smoother navigation
* Open source
* Syntax Highlighting
* Filtering by filename
* Text search in file (including with Regex)
* Ability to create new files directly in the archive
* And many more in the future!

At this very early stage I am mostly looking for feedback so if you have any thoughts feel free to open a ticket or find me on discord @Necro#6714. I can usually be found on quite a few BFME/SAGE servers.
